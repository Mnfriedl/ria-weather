# Introduction

This project was made as the coding assignment for Ria's interview process. There was an initial setup of the repo, which involved:
- Creating the base project using Vite + React + TS.
- Adding some basic libraries like:
  - TailwindCSS (my preferred way of doing css right now)
  - Tanstack Query
  - Axios
  - ShadCN setup

After the initial setup of the repo (you can check the first commit done to this repository to see what was done in this step), a 2hr timer was started. During these two hours, the development of the weather application took place.

## How to run the project

Execute the commands:
- `yarn`
- `yarn dev`
